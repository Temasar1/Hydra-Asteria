# Build Ship (Hydra Mesh Example)

Creates a `ShipState` UTxO locking min ada and a `ShipToken` (minted in this tx),  
specifying in the datum the initial `pos_x` and `pos_y` coordinates of the ship,  
and setting `fuel` to an initial amount.  
Also adds to the `AsteriaUTxO` value the `SHIP_MINT_FEE` paid by the user.

## Mesh Example

You can use the following Mesh code to build your ship on **Hydra**.  
The heavy lifting (Plutus logic, datum building, minting, etc.) is handled in `createShip`.  
Here, you only need to **pass in the position variables**.

<CodeBlock content={`import { hydraProvider, hydraWallet } from "../../utils.js";
import { createShip } from "../user/createShip.js";

async function main() {

  const posX = 20;
  const posY = 20;

  await hydraProvider.connect();

  const txHash = await createShip(posX, posY);

  console.log("Ship created with tx hash:", txHash);
}

main();
`} />
