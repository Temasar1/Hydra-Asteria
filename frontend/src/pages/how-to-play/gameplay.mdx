# Gameplay (Hydra Version)

## Building a ship

- To create a ship, the participant mints a new `ShipToken` and matching `PilotToken` through a mint validator called `ShipyardPolicy`.
- Each Pilot/Ship token pair is unique. The validator ensures uniqueness by incrementing a counter stored in the `AsteriaUtxo`.
- The asset names of the `ShipToken` and `PilotToken` include the counter value as a suffix, e.g. `SHIP23` and `PILOT23`.
- The `ShipToken` must be locked in the `SpaceTimeScript`, while the `PilotToken` is sent to the participant’s wallet.
- Minting requires paying the constant `SHIP_MINT_FEE`, which is added to the `AsteriaUtxo` reward pot.

## Moving your ship

- Movement is achieved by consuming the `ShipState` UTxO and producing a new one with updated coordinates.
- Each movement consumes fuel. The amount of fuel burned is proportional to the distance moved, defined by the constant `FUEL_PER_DISTANCE_UNIT`.

## Gathering fuel

- Gathering fuel requires consuming both the `ShipUtxo` and a `PelletUtxo`, producing a new `ShipUtxo` with increased fuel.
- A ship can only gather fuel if its position overlaps with the pellet’s position on the grid.
- The total fuel in a ship cannot exceed the `MAX_SHIP_FUEL` parameter.
- If the fuel pellet contains more fuel than the ship can take, a new `PelletUtxo` is recreated with the leftover fuel at the same grid location.

## Mining Asteria

- Mining is achieved by consuming both the `ShipUtxo` and `AsteriaUtxo`, and outputting a new state where assets are transferred from `AsteriaUtxo` into the participant’s wallet.
- The maximum extractable amount is constrained by the `MAX_ASTERIA_MINING` percentage of the total available assets.
- Mining requires that the ship be located at coordinates `(0, 0)` on the grid.
