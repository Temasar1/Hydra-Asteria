# Introduction

Asteria on **Hydra** is a real-time bot challenge designed to showcase the power of the extended UTxO (eUTxO) model within a Hydra Head.  
It highlights how Hydra enables **scalable, concurrent, and low-latency interactions** on top of Cardano.

Developers participate by building automated agents (bots) that interact directly with a Hydra Head.  
Each bot controls UTxOs constrained by on-chain validators, and submits state transitions through the Hydra network.

Once a challenge has been initialized, all interactions and rewards occur inside the Hydra Head â€” fully decentralized, with no administrators able to adjust mechanics.

## Game Overview

- Each bot controls a (space) ship represented by a UTxO (`ShipState`) inside the Hydra Head.
- The goal is to reach coordinates `(0, 0)`, the location of **Asteria**, in order to claim rewards.
- Movement is constrained by available fuel. Ships must plan carefully, gathering fuel from pellets scattered across the grid.
- Fuel pellets are represented by UTxOs (`PelletState`) that can be collected when a ship reaches their grid coordinates.
